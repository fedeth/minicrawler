# MiniCrawler

## Premise
I have realized that my knowledge of Elixir is very shallow. I have used Elixir and Phoenix in the past months but I was in charge only for simple maintenance tasks of a side project. This is the first time that I’ve tried to build something from scratch with this language. I spent all my free time studying the official docs trying to accomplish the challenge.
I’m aware that my current knowledge of the language is not sufficient to cover the role I applied for, but I was glad to learn something about Elixir and FP!
